This work was led by my research mentor Yoojin at Georgia Tech.</p>

<p>While pursuing my own project on cathode materials, I contributed to this work by preparing some of the electrode samples for electrochemical characterization and assisting with the final proofreading of the manuscript.</p>

<p>I’m truly excited about this achievement, and would like to thank Yoojin and all the co-authors for their great collaboration.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate researcher, I presented my ongoing work on investigating the effect of surface treatment on Ni/Mn-based Co-free layered oxide cathode for Li-ion Batteries. You can find the poster in the “Projects” section of this website.</p>

<p>This was my very first poster presentation. The whole processes of desiging the poster, preparing a short pitch, and answering questions from the audience helped me further develop my scientific comuunication skills. It was truly a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>I’d like to give a special shout-out to my mentor Yoojin and my advisor Prof. Meilin Liu for their invaluable advice and support.</p>
