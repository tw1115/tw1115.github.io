<p>Since I had been considering pursuing a Ph.D. in the U.S., I wanted to experience what life at a U.S. university would be like and see how well I could adapt during the exchange. However, adjusting to a new environment wasn’t as easy as it seemed. The cultural differences with Korea were greater than I expected, and I often struggled to express myself naturally since I wasn’t used to speaking English on a daily basis. Nevertheless, I pushed myself beyond my comfort zone and embraced new experiences, while also being fortunate to meet many supportive friends along the way. Over time, I found myself adapting more smoothly than I had expected, and I started to appreciate dynamic atmosphere and diverse perspectives around me. This journey not only boosted my confidence in English but also convinced me that I can thrive both academically and personally in the United States.</p>

<p>During the exchange, I devoted much of my effort to the research. At Prof. Meilin Liu’s lab, I deepened my understanding of lithium-ion batteries and gained valuable research experience working on cathode materials. Presenting my work in lab meetings and poster sessions further improved my scientific communication skills and prepared me for future academic challenges.</p>

<p>Beyond research, I lived in international dormitories (I-Lead and I-House), where I built lasting friendships with students from around the world. These interactions broadened my cultural awareness and communication skills, making the exchange a truly transformative chapter of my life journey.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate researcher, I presented my ongoing work on investigating the effect of surface treatment on Ni/Mn-based Co-free layered oxide cathode for Li-ion Batteries. You can find the poster in the “Projects” section of this website.</p>

<p>This was my very first poster presentation. The whole processes of desiging the poster, preparing a short pitch, and answering questions from the audience helped me further develop my scientific comuunication skills. It was truly a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>I’d like to give a special shout-out to my mentor Yoojin and my advisor Prof. Meilin Liu for their invaluable advice and support.</p>
