As an undergraduate researcher, I presented my ongoing work on investigating the effect of surface treatment on Ni/Mn-based Co-free layered oxide cathode for Li-ion Batteries. You can find the poster in the “Project” section of this website.
This was my very first poster presentation. The whole processes of desiging the poster, preparing a short pitch, and answering questions from the audience helped me further develop my scientific comuunication skills. It was truly a fantastic experience.
I’d like to give a special shout-out to my mentor Yoojin and my advisor Prof. Meilin Liu for their invaluable advice and support.</p>
