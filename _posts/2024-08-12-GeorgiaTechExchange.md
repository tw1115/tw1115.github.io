Right after getting discharged from my service duty, I'm starting new chapter of my academic journey at Georgia Institute of Technology. Go Jackets! üêù

At Georgia Tech, I will be joining [Prof. Meilin Liu's research group](https://fcbt.mse.gatech.edu) as an undergraduate researcher, focusing on studying electrode materials for Lithium-ion batteries. In addition, I will be taking relevant courseworks, such as *Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion*, to fulfill my degree requirements at KAIST.

I'm also honored to be a recipient of KOR-US High-Tech Industry Student Exchange Scholarship, as the part of the [KOR-US STEM Educational Exchange Initiative](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20230427/korea-us-to-nurture-young-stem-experts). This scholarship provides financial support of 9,000 USD and opportunities to visit leading research facilities across the United States.
