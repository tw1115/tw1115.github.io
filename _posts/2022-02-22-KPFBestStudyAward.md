I won third prize out of 26 teams in the Best Study Award at the KPF Academic Conference!

I submitted the work from my URP (KAIST Undergraduate Research Program) project last year, “Developing an Electrolytic Zn-Mn Battery System and Identifying Key Operating Conditions.” The full report can be found in the "Projects" section of this website.

I’m grateful to my mentor Kyungjae and my advisor Prof. Hee-Tak Kim for their support.
