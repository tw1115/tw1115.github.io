I gave a poster presentation at the 12th Annual MRS Poster Competition, organized by the MRS Chapter at Georgia Tech and held at the Marcus Nanotechnology Building.

As an undergraduate researcher, I presented my ongoing work on investigating the effect of surface treatment on Ni/Mn-based Co-free layered oxide cathode for Li-ion Batteries. You can find the poster in the "Projects" section of this website.

This was my very first poster presentation. The whole processes of desiging the poster, preparing a short pitch, and answering questions from the audience helped me further develop my scientific comuunication skills. It was truly a fantastic experience.

I'd like to give a special shout-out to my mentor Yoojin and my advisor Prof. Meilin Liu for their invaluable advice and support.
