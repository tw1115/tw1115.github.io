My first paper as a co-author, ["Synergistic Effects of Entropy Tuning in Niobium-Based Oxide Anode for Fast-Charging Lithium-Ion Batteries"](https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202509533), has been published in *Advanced Functional Materials*. This work was led by my research mentor Yoojin at Georgia Tech.

While pursuing my own project on cathode materials, I contributed to this work by preparing some of the electrode samples for electrochemical characterization and assisting with the final proofreading of the manuscript.

I'm truly excited about this achievement, and would like to thank Yoojin and all the co-authors for their great collaboration.

The full paper can be found under "Publications" tab.
