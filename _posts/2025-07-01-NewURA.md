Returning to my home university, I started a new position as an undergraduate research assistant in [Energy Materials Lab (PI: Prof. Nam-Soon Choi)](https://surfchem.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST. I will focus on studying electrolyte additives suitable for Na-ion batteries under low-temperature condition. I'm excited to delve into this new system and look forward to making meaningful contributions.
