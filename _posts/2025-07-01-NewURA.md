Returning to my home university, I started a new position as an undergraduate research assistant at Energy Materials Lab (PI: Prof. Nam-Soon Choi) at KAIST. I will focus on studying electrolyte additives suitable for Na-ion batteries under low-temperature condition. I'm excited to delve into new kind of system and looking forward to the contribution.
