I have successfully completed my exchange program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I had the opportunity to adapt to a new environment, pursue research, and connect with a diverse international community.

Since I had been considering pursuing a Ph.D. in the U.S., I wanted to experience what life at a U.S. university would be like and see how well I could adapt during the exchange. However, adjusting to a new environment wasn't as easy as it seemed. The cultural differences with Korea were greater than I expected, and I often struggled to express myself naturally since I wasn't used to speaking English on a daily basis. Nevertheless, I pushed myself beyond my comfort zone and embraced new experiences, while also being fortunate to meet many supportive friends along the way. Over time, I found myself adapting more smoothly than I had expected, and I started to appreciate dynamic atmosphere and diverse perspectives around me. This journey not only boosted my confidence in English but also convinced me that I can thrive both academically and personally in the United States.

During the exchange, I devoted much of my effort to the research. At Prof. Meilin Liuâ€™s lab, I deepened my understanding of lithium-ion batteries and gained valuable research experience working on cathode materials. Presenting my work in lab meetings and poster sessions further improved my scientific communication skills and prepared me for future academic challenges.

Beyond research, I lived in international dormitories (I-Lead and I-House), where I built lasting friendships with students from around the world. These interactions broadened my cultural awareness and communication skills, making the exchange a truly transformative chapter of my life journey.

It's a little bit bittersweet to say goodbye to Georgia Tech, but I also look forward to embarking on a new chapter back at KAIST!
