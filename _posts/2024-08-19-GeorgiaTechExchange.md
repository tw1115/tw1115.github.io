Right after getting discharged from my service duty, I'm starting new chapter of my academic journey at Georgia Institute of Technology.

At Georgia Tech, I will be joining [Prof. Meilin Liu's research group](https://fcbt.mse.gatech.edu) as an undergraduate researcher, where I will be focusing on studying electrode materials for Lithium-ion batteries. In addition, I will be taking relevant courseworks, such as Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion, to fulfil my degree requirements at KAIST.

I'm also honored to be a recipient of KOR-US High-Tech Industry Student Exchange Scholarship. This scholarship provides significant financial support of 9,000 USD and invaluable opportunities to visit leading research facilities across the U.S.
