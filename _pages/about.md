Hello! I'm an undergraduate student studying **Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering** and **Materials Science Engineering** at **Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)**. I also finished the academic year-long exchange program at **Georgia Institute of Technology** for Fall 2024 - Spring 2025.

My research interests focus on optimizing electrode-electrolyte interphases through strategic materials design for Li- and Na‚Äìbased batteries to realize the next-generation batteries. My interests are not confined to these systems and I'm open to study more various systems, such as all-solid-state batteries or applying computational methods

In my free time, I enjoy taking photos with my film camera üì∑, going bouldering üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and listening to pop songs üéß.

I will be applying to Ph.D. programs in the United States this fall!
