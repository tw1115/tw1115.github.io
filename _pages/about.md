Hello! I'm an undergraduate student at the **Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)**, double majoring in **Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering** and **Materials Science and Engineering**. I also recently completed a year-long exchange program at the **Georgia Institute of Technology** (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025).

My research interest lies in **optimizing electrode-electrolyte interphases in Li- and Na-based batteries** through strategic materials design. Building on my undergraduate research experience, I'm eager to explore other promising frontiers, such as **designing better materials for all-solid-state batteries** and **applying computational methods to accelerate materials discovery**.

I will graduate in Spring 2026 and am now in the process of applying to Ph.D. programs in the U.S. for Fall 2026 admission to continue my academic journey.

In my free time, I enjoy taking photos with my film camera 📷, bouldering 🧗‍♂️, running 🏃‍♂️, and listening to my favorite music 🎧.
